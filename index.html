      <ul>
        <li><strong class="bold__text">1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to
          attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
          known as the "National Youth Administration"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save
          up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
          starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of
          this left scars on me."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1937</strong> - Finishes university and
          takes a job in the US Forestry Service
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years
          Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin
          Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches
          him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the
          military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
          military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
          malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in
          Genetics and Plant Pathology
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary
          increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to
          Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,
          his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
          including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown
          wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy
          dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a
          strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
          Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his
          high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to
          help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace
          Prize

        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1983</strong> - helps seven African
          countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished
          professor at Texas A&M University
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">2005</strong> - states "we will have to
          double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
          modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out
          of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous
          because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a
          long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
          best breeds."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="bold__text">2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.
